# Seq2Seq Modeling Language Translation (LSTM)

This project demonstrates how to build a Seq2Seq (Sequence-to-Sequence) model using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) for language translation. The model is trained on a French-to-English translation dataset (`fra.txt`), which contains French sentences paired with their English translations.

## Introduction

Seq2Seq modeling is a powerful approach for tasks that involve mapping sequences to sequences, such as machine translation. In this project, we use an LSTM-based Seq2Seq model for translating sentences from French to English.

## Features

- LSTM-based Seq2Seq model for French-to-English translation.
- Training and evaluation on a provided dataset (`fra.txt`).
- Ability to test the model with new input sentences.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    - Clone the project repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
    - Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended).
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
    - Install the required Python packages using the provided `requirements.txt` file.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Download the Dataset**:
    - Ensure that the French-to-English translation dataset (`fra.txt`) is available in the project directory.

## Usage

1. **Train the Model**:
    - Run the script to train the model on the provided dataset.
    ```bash
    python train.py
    ```

2. **Test the Model**:
    - After training, test the model with new input sentences.
    ```bash
    python test.py
    ```

## Data

- The French-to-English translation dataset (`fra.txt`) contains French sentences paired with their English translations.
- The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets for model development and evaluation.

## Model Architecture

- The model consists of an encoder-decoder architecture based on LSTM.
    - **Encoder**: Processes input sentences (French) and encodes them into a fixed-size vector.
    - **Decoder**: Generates output sentences (English) based on the encoded vector and a given initial token.

## Code Explanation

- **train.py**:
    - Contains the code for training the Seq2Seq LSTM model.
    - Loads the dataset, preprocesses the data, and trains the model.
    - Saves the trained model to a file for later use.

- **test.py**:
    - Contains the code for testing the trained model.
    - Loads the trained model and allows the user to input French sentences.
    - The model translates the input sentences to English and displays the results.
